# Read-More-Label
A label that you use to add a trailing text based on the number of lines you specify

## Why do you need this?

This repo is based on a solution found online but it doesnt handle one scenario i.e number of lines , it is totally dependent on the frame of the label.This repo handles that problem and adds a trailing text based on the number of lines you specify.
